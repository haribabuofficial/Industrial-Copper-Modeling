# Industrial-Copper-Modeling

The objective is to use data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict the selling price and status (won or lost) of copper transactions in the industrial market.

The solution must include the following steps:
  1)Exploring skewness and outliers in the dataset.
  2) Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.  
  3) ML Regression model which predicts continuous variable ‘Selling_Price’.
  4) ML Classification model which predicts Status: WON or LOST.
  5) Creating a streamlit page where you can insert each column value and you will get the Selling_Price predicted value or Status(Won/Lost)
